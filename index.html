        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its
        layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
        to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
        page
        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
        sites
        still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
        purpose
        (injected humour and the like).
