        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
            type
            specimen
            book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
            essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
            passages,
            and more
            recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at
            its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed
            to using
            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
            page
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
            web
            sites
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
            purpose
            (injected humour and the like).
